    <center><h2>Workout Routines for Men: The Ultimate Guide</h2></center>
    <br> 
    <p>Whether you’re looking to shed pounds or add bulk, here’s how to tailor <br>
         your workout to help you reach your fitness goals.</p>
         <br>
         <p>When it comes to achieving your best physique, <br>
             a proper strength training program is essential. <br> <br>

            Whether you’re looking to transform your body or just kick your training up a notch, <br> 
             it’s important to add training volume (in the form of reps, sets, and weight) to stimulate new muscle growth as you progress. <br> <br>
            
            In general, most beginners have been lifting for less than a year, intermediates for at <br>
            least 1 year, and advanced trainees for at least 2 years. Keep in mind that <br>
             you should not attempt advanced workouts unless you have appropriate strength training experience. <br> <br>
            
            This article reviews several high quality exercise regimens for men of all experience <br>
             levels to maximize muscle and strength gains while ensuring adequate recovery.  <br> <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Beginner’s workout routine for men</h2>
            <img src="./images/Michael Vazquez.jpeg" alt="pic" width="300px">
            <p>Starting out in the gym can seem intimidating, but with proper guidance, <br>
                 the process becomes more approachable — and even invigorating. <br> <br>

                As a beginner, you can progress very quickly because almost <br>
                any exercise promotes muscle and strength gains. Still, <br>
                it’s important to avoid overexertion, which can lead to injuries or decreased performance. <br> <br>
                
                This workout routine has you in the gym 3 days per week <br>
                (such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with full-body sessions completed each day. <br>
                 This allows you to get used to new movements, focus on proper form, and take time to recover. <br> <br> 
                
                You can add reps and sets as needed as you progress. <br>
                
                The beginner phase should last as long as you continue to improve. <br> 
                Some people may plateau at around 6 months, whereas others may continue to see results for more than a year. <br> <br>

            <h2>Intermediate workout routine</h2>
            <img src="./images/Is Deadlifting Worth the Risk_.jpeg" alt="pix" width="300">
            <p>After working hard in the gym for several months, it’s time to  <br>
                step your training up a notch to keep your gains coming. <br> <br>

                At this point, you should have good exercise technique and be <br>
                 able to handle more weight on the bar. <br> <br>
                
                This 4-day-per-week intermediate program increases reps and sets <br>
                 to stimulate new muscle growth. When they become too easy, you <br>
                  can gradually add more weight or more reps/sets. <br> <br>
                
                If you do it correctly, you can follow this routine for several <br>
                years until you reach an advanced level. It may be helpful to switch  <br>
                up your exercises on occasion to keep yourself engaged and prevent burnout. <br> <br>
                
                Remember that soreness is not always an indicator of muscle growth. <br>
                Now that you have some training experience, you may not get sore after every workout. <br> <br>
                <strong>Equipment required:</strong> fully equipped gym <br>

                <strong>Rest intervals:</strong> 90–180 seconds for main movements, 60–90 seconds for accessories <br>
                
                    <strong>Intensity:</strong> Select a weight that allows you to complete the prescribed reps while <br>
                     leaving about 2 solid reps in the tank. To increase intensity, go to your limit on the last set. <br>

            <h2>Advanced workout routine for men</h2>
            <img src="./images/58598be9-1cc1-4b8a-bb19-6b051d64777e.jpeg" alt="piv" width="300">
            <p>
                
                Additional volume (sets and reps) and intensity (weight on the bar) are <br>
                 essential for advanced gym-goers to keep gaining muscle. <br>
                 Keep in mind that you should not attempt this routine unless you’ve been <br>
                  training consistently for 2 or more years. <br> <br>

                While the muscle gains won’t come as fast as they did when you were <br>
                a beginner, there’s still room for significant progress at this stage. <br> <br>
                
                This grueling workout routine has you in the gym 6 days per week with <br>
                 1 rest day in between. It follows a pull-push-legs pattern, hitting <br>
                 each muscle group twice per week, with supersets incorporated for maximum hypertrophy (muscle growth). <br> <br>
                
                Again, you can increase weight on the bar, as well as sets and reps, <br>
                from week to week to ensure continued progress while following this program. <br>

               <strong> Equipment required:</strong>  fully equipped gym <br>

               <strong>Rest periods:</strong> 90–180 seconds for main movements, 60–90 seconds for accessories <br>

                <strong>Intensity:</strong> Select a weight that allows you to complete the prescribed reps while <br>
                 leaving about 2 solid reps in the tank. To increase intensity, go to failure on the last set. <br> <br>

                    <strong>Supersets:</strong> Complete the initial set of the first movement immediately followed by <br>
                    the second movement. Repeat until all designated reps and sets are complete. <br> <br>

                        <strong>Pull A </strong> <br> <br>
                            <strong>Back/hamstrings:</strong> barbell deadlift — 5 sets of 5 reps <br>
