   <center> <h2> The Ultimate Calisthenics Workout Transformation</h2></center>
   <br>
    <p>Calisthenics is a type of workout that uses a person’s body weight with little or no equipment. <br>

        The exercises involve movements that use large muscle groups, such as pushups. <br>
         People typically perform these exercises at a moderate pace. They help to improve coordination, flexibility, and strength. <br>
        
        Calisthenics originated in Ancient Greece and remains popular today. <br>
         Most people can perform these exercises, regardless of the level of their athletic ability. Many of them do not require any equipment. <br>
        
        </p>
        <h2>
            Calisthenics Vs. Weight Training
        </h2>


<img src="./images/IS He Even Human _! - Flying Heavyweight Calisthenics Beast.png" alt="pic" width="300px">        <p>
    The term calisthenics refers to training that uses primarily bodyweight <br>
     exercises to develop strength, endurance, mobility, and coordination.  <br>
     It’s the kind of exercise that gymnasts and martial artists have done <br>
      for eons using their own body weight, and while it develops muscle mass  <br>
      too, that’s more of a byproduct. You can expect to get very strong relative  <br> 
       to your bodyweight when you do calisthenics training, and master your control  <br>
       of your body in various positions and movements. I.e., you’ll become stable and athletic. <br> <br> <br>
       <img src="./images/bbd40c9a-5aad-4217-8d1f-de4b56ba0626.jpeg" alt="pic" width="200px"> <br>

       Weight training uses external loads—free weights, cables, machines—to strengthen  <br>
       the body, and while it can develop the same qualities that calisthenics can,  <br>
       it’s better-suited for those who want to build maximum muscle mass, power, and <br>
        absolute strength. This makes it a potentially better choice for athletes in  <br> 
        sports like football, baseball, and track and field. A gymnast will usually be <br>
         able to do more pullups and pushups than a bodybuilder or powerlifter, but the <br>
          one who lifts heavy weights can probably move more overall load and will look <br> 
           bigger and stronger. Neither kind of training is superior to the other— both <br>
            have their advantages, depending on your goals.
</p>
<h2>How Long Should You Recover After A Calisthenics Workout?</h2>
<p>Each of these workouts can be performed up to four times per week on non-consecutive days. <br>
    Three to four workouts per week is enough. For example, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday.  <br>
    You can also combine them, performing the At-Home workout one day, the Intermediate on another,  <br>
    and the Advanced (if you dare!) on a third day. If you feel extra sore or run down on a day <br>
     you had planned to train, take another day’s rest before your next workout  <br>
     (or perform light exercise or aerobic activity, such as walking/jogging, cycling, yoga, mobility work, etc.).</p>
     <br>
     <h2>At-Home Calisthenics Circuit Workout</h2>
     <p>
        Here’s a bodyweight workout that’s appropriate whether you’re a total beginner <br>
         to training or you have a little experience with lifting weights but you want <br>
          to get back to basics with calisthenics training. You can do this routine at <br>
          home if you have a pullup bar, and it may help to have an elastic exerciseb <br>
           band as well, which can help to unload some of your bodyweight and make  <br>
           exercises like chinups and dips easier. <br>
           <!--here i will a youtube video-->

           <p> <strong>1. Chinup </strong> <br> <br>

            Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>
            
            [See 00:49 in the video above] <br> <br>
            
            Use a shoulder-width grip and turn your palms to face you. If you can’t get at least <br>
             5 reps on your own, attach an elastic exercise band around the bar and stand in the open loop to unload some of your bodyweight. <br> <br>
            
            <strong>2. Dip</strong> <br> <br>
            
            Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>
            
            [See 01:00 in the video] <br> <br>
            
            Lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. If you can’t <br>
             get at least 5 reps on your own, attach an elastic exercise band to the dip bars <br>
              and stand (or kneel) in the open loop to unload some of your bodyweight. <br>
               If you don’t have dip bars, you can use the backs of two chairs. <br> <br>
            
            <strong>3. Jump Squat</strong> <br> <br>
            
            Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>
            
            [See 01:15 in the video] <br> <br>
            
            Stand with feet between hip and shoulder-width and quickly lower <br>
             your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Explode upward  <br>
             as high as you can. Land softly, and reset yourself before you begin the next rep. <br> <br>
            
            <strong>4. Pushup </strong> <br> <br>
            
            Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>
            
            [See 01:28 in the video]  <br> <br>
            
            Place your hands just outside shoulder width and lower your body <br>
             until your chest is about an inch above the floor. Keep your body  <br>
             in a straight line with your core braced. Your lower back shouldn’t  <br>
             arch and your elbows should point 45 degrees from your torso. <br> <br>
            
           <strong> 5. Crunch</strong> <br> <br>
            
            Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>
            
            [See 02:08 in the video] <br> <br>
            
            Raise your torso until your shoulder blades are off the floor. <br> <br>
            
            <strong>6. Mountain Climber</strong> <br> <br>
            
            Reps: Go for 30 seconds <br> <br>
            
            [See 02:19 in the video] <br> <br>
            
            Stand with feet shoulder width and squat down to place your hands on the floor. <br> 
             Now shoot your legs behind you fast so you end up in the top position of a pushup. <br>
              Jump your legs back up so they land between your hands and then stand up quickly. <br> <br>
            
           <strong>BONUS: Jump Rope</strong>  <br> <br>
            
            Reps: Jump for 30 seconds  <br> <br>

            [See 02:26 in the video] <br> <br>
            
            If you have a jump rope, jump for 30 seconds, <br>
            landing on the balls of your feet. Any type of jump is OK, or mix a few together.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Intermediate Calisthenics Circuit Workout
            </h2>
            <p>
                This workout is good for people with a year or more of strength <br>
                training or bodyweight-only training under their belt. You can do it <br>
                 at home, but you’ll need a pullup bar and some space to run, so a  <br>
                 public park or a gym may be more appropriate. <br>

<strong>2. Feet-Elevated Inverted Row</strong> <br> <br>

Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>

[See 01:20 in the video] <br> <br>

Set the handles of a suspension trainer low enough so that  <br>
when you hang from them with arms extended, your body is  <br>
angled 45 degrees to the floor, or lower. (If you’re strong enough,  <br>
 rest your feet on a bench for an added challenge.) Keep your body <br>
 in a straight line and brace your core as you pull yourself up. <br> <br>

<strong>3. Jump Squat</strong> <br> <br>

Reps: As many as possible <br> <br>

[See 01:39 in the video] <br> <br>

Reps: Repeat for 60 seconds <br> <br>

[See 02:38 in the video] <br> <br>
 
Flatten your lower back into the floor and brace your abs. <br>
 Extend your legs overhead and then lower them as far as  <br>
 you can before you feel your lower back is about to buckle up from the floor.  <br>
 Begin raising and lowering both legs, alternately, a few inches <br>
  (as if you were kicking your legs while swimming).  <br> <br>

<strong>6. Sprint</strong> <br> <br>

Reps: Run for 30 seconds <br> <br>

[See 02:58 in the video] <br> <br>

Run as fast as you can maintain for 30 seconds. <br>

            <h2>Advanced Calisthenics Circuit Routine </h2>
            <p>If you’ve been training for a few years and feel pretty strong <br>
                on bodyweight exercises, give this advanced routine a shot.</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSB4-l-tqpY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <strong>1. Crow Pose</strong> <br> <br>

Reps: Hold for 30 seconds <br> <br>

[See 00:28 in the video above] <br> <br>

Get into a deep squat position and plant your hands on the floor. <br>
 Tip your body forward and rest your knees on your elbows.  <br>
 Extend your back and hips so that your bodyweight is supported on your hands, <br>
  and hold the position. <br> <br>

<strong>2. Jump Squat with Rotation </strong> <br> <br>

Reps: Jump in the 3 directions shown for 30 seconds <br> <br>

[See 01:02 in the video] <br> <br>

Lower your body into a squat quickly and then explode upward as high <br>
as you can. Swing your arms back as you go down, and throw them forward as <br>
you jump. Land softly, driving your knees outward. Hop 90 degrees to your right side, <br>
 and repeat the jump. Hop back to face forward again, jump, and then rotate to  <br>
 face your left side, and jump again. Continue in this manner, jumping in the three  <br>
  different directions. Don’t let your knees cave inward on your landings, and make each jump as vertical as possible. <br>

 <Strong>3. Hindu Pushup </Strong>  <br> <br>

Reps: Repeat for 30 seconds  <br> <br>

[See 01:40 in the video] <br> <br>

Get into pushup position and drive your hips backward as you extend your arms overhead. <br>
You’ll end up in a downward dog pose. Now lower your chest toward the floor in an <br>
arcing motion, finishing the pushup with your chest facing forward and your hips just <br> 
 above the floor (an upward dog pose). Keep your core braced so that your <br>
 ribs don’t flare, and avoid shrugging your shoulders. Keep your shoulder blades <br>
  together and pulled downward as you move toward the floor, and spread them apart  <br>
  as you push up. <br> 

<strong>4. Candlestick Roll</strong> <br> <br>

Reps: Repeat for 30 seconds <br> <br>

[See 02:30 in the video] <br> <br>

Get into a deep squat and roll backward onto your shoulders. Roll forward again <br>
 and go into the bottom of a deep lunge with your back knee pointing 90 degrees <br>
 to the side. The heel of your front foot should stay flat on the floor. <br>
 \Repeat on the other side. <br>

<strong>5. Lateral Squat w/ Rotation</strong> <br> <br> 

Reps: Repeat for 30 seconds <br> <br>

[See 02:59 in the video] <br> <br>

Shift your weight to your left leg so you feel like you’re sitting into your <br>
left glute. Now raise your right knee up and outward, planting your right foot <br>
on the floor at a 90 degree angle—both heels should be in line. Lower your body <br>
 into a squat, keeping a long spine from your head to your pelvis. <br>
 Alternate sides each rep. <br>

<strong>6. Xs and Os</strong> <br> <br>

Reps: Repeat for 30 seconds <br> <br>

[See 03:25 in the video] <br> <br>

Lie on your back and extend your arms and legs to form an X shape. <br> 
Flatten your lower back into the floor. Perform a crunch, drawing <br>
 your knees to your chest along with your arms. <br>
